description="'Mechanism Design' is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts required in good game design. Simply put, it is the idea that the game creator, by manipulating the rules of the game, can encourage, without coercion, particular play behavior. Or, to put it another way, a game can manipulate you into certain behaviors you might not otherwise have considered. While it's one of those scary, math-heavy 'game theory' constructs, it can be illustrated (and used) without an advanced mathematics degree. If you're a gamer, it's likely been used to great effect on you already. Why not learn the secrets behind the science of game-centered mind control? From the creators of Beyond Dungeons & Dragons, Beyond Candyland, and Losing Should Be Fun.

Why would they want to do that? In order to make more money, of course. Without Net Neutrality rules, ISPs could charge large websites and service providers for access to a 'fast lane,' leaving indie developers, small publishers and the rest of us stuck in the 'slow lane'. We'll explain why Net Neutrality is important, why the gaming community needs to get involved and how you can help.

Kasavin's unique experience having worked as editor-in-chief of a major gaming publication, as a line producer on a noted development team, and on the publishing side of a company behind some of the year's biggest games has given him a broad perspective he hopes will usher in a new age of peace and prosperity in the industry.
