	"Mix CD swap at the Harmonix booth!"
 In true DIY spirit, a bunch of HMX folks are making mix CDs and we're hoping that some of you will bring mixes with you as well. 
Drop off a mix, take a mix and maybe discover some new music in the process. 
Nothing too formal, just a good old fashioned music exchange. We'll be doing this all day long and maybe on into Saturday if there's enough interest.
