description="Using the lo-bit sound chips trapped within retro videogame consoles and other vintage electronics to synthesize new forms of musical composition, chiptune artists across the globe have slowly but surely brought enthusiasm for their craft to a fever pitch. The basements of yesteryear have become stages, and the upon those stages a new breed of performer has arisen -- not to merely evoke the nostalgic timbres of Nintendo-era videogame music, but to re-define and celebrate the limitations of the machines we once called our toys. From videogame soundtracks and demoscene/cracktro hackers to the thriving underground music scenes that exist today, join chiptune journalist Zen Albatross as he expounds on the vibrant history and promising future of chip music."

In this panel we'll talk about the characteristics that make a good game designer, and specific skills we look for when hiring on new talent.

Part focus group and part interrogation, this panel turns the traditional notion of a QandA on its head, giving community members the opportunity to answer questions submitted by developers. You may be wonder: 'What kind of questions will be asked?' and 'Do attendees answer individually or as a collective?' and 'Will this be a disaster?' Continue to wonder, because the Harmonix folks aren't dishing out any answers, only questions.

    description="The games industry is evolving. Social Games, once a fringe games industry enclave, discussed under hushed tones in shadowy corners of interactive entertainment gatherings, has taken its place as an established game development discipline with nuances, best practices, and pillars all its own. That said, are 'Triple-A' console games like Call of Duty so different from smash hit Social Games like FrontierVille and Mafia Wars? Is it possible that Call of Duty conned us into believing it was just another shooter, when it was actually a groundbreaking foray into the burgeoning Social Games space? This session examines the core compulsion loops, long-term feedback mechanics, and economy or itemization strategies of games like Call of Duty, and explores the parallels between the console shooter market's biggest blockbuster and the industry's newest untamed frontier.

    name="The 'Other' Us: If We're All Gamers, Does Our Gender Matter?"
	description="Abbie Heppe's review of Metroid: Other M prompted a wave of backlash across the gaming community. Words like 'feminist' got thrown around in comments sections of popular gaming sites as if it were the new 'f' word. But what is really feminist versus what is perceived as feminist by virtue of the fact that it comes from a woman's perspective? Using these reactions as a jumping off point, a panel of gamers, journalists, and members of the industry will look at the ways gender is treated in gaming culture at large. In our debate and discussion of Abbie's review, we'll be looking at the larger question: 'As our industry becomes more progressive and, arguably, gender-blind, is geek and gamer culture regressing?'
Panelists include: Alli Thresher [Community Moderator, Harmonix Music Systems, Inc], Abbie Heppe [Senior Gaming Content Producer, G4 TV], Eric Pope [Community Moderator, Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.], Yesenia Cisneros [Games Tester, Excell], Jennifer Kye [Company Blogger, Social Media Editor, Gameloft]"

	name="Ledo and Ix Screening and QandA"
	description="The Adventures of Ledo and Ix is the latest series to air on PATV. Inspired by a deep love of FFIV and A Link To The Past, its story delves the inner lives of two characters in a 1990s RPG as they ask themselves the really Big Questions: Who are we, and how many points to we have? Is it wrong to take townspeople's stuff? And what happens when the quest is over?

Season One of Ledo and Ix will be screened in dazzling high definition (including a first look at Episodes 6 and 7), and the audience will be invited to participate in a moderated discussion with series creator Emily Carmichael. Much like an electron's, the flitting movements of Carmichael's thought process are outside our or any human's power to predict, but those familiar with her in private life know she enjoys discussing the relative merits of Final Fantasy games (including those she has not played all the way through), as well as the Big Issues of Gender, Genre Tropes and Storytelling.

	description="Minecraft, the indie PC game designed by Markus Persson (aka. notch), ignited the gaming scene inspiring communities to band together to, of all things, create. Create castles, rollercoasters, and 1:1 scale copies of the Starship Enterprise out of blocks... but what does Minecraft uncover about today's gamers and game culture? Media scholar Alex Leavitt will look at the development and spread of Minecraft to explain the cultural implications behind why notch spends hours interacting with fans, how online forums are replacing outdated game manuals, and what value there is in the hundreds of thousands of YouTube videos that feature players building dilapidated forts. A panel for Minecraft newbies and seasoned tree-punching veterans alike."
