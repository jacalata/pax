Everything I Know About Social Games I Learned From Call of Duty
IGDA Dev Center
Friday, 2:00pm - 3:00pm

The games industry is evolving. Social Games, once a fringe games industry enclave, discussed under hushed tones in shadowy corners of interactive entertainment gatherings, has taken its place as an established game development discipline with nuances, best practices, and pillars all its own. That said, are "Triple-A" console games like Call of Duty so different from smash hit Social Games like FrontierVille and Mafia Wars? Is it possible that Call of Duty conned us into believing it was just another shooter, when it was actually a groundbreaking foray into the burgeoning Social Games space? This session examines the core compulsion loops, long-term feedback mechanics, and economy/itemization strategies of games like Call of Duty, and explores the parallels between the console shooter market’s biggest blockbuster and the industry’s newest untamed frontier.

House Rules and Stealing from Other Games in RPGS
Merman Theatre
Friday, 6:30pm - 7:30pm

Most Game Masters do it. Hacking your favourite RPG is as old as the hobby itself. However, one can often get bogged down with rules that defeat their intent and make the game less fun.

That’s why we invite you to join 3 well-known RPG bloggers from Critical-Hits and At-Will to discuss how to design, test, and organize house rules. They’ll also tell you how to explore other classic and modern RPGs to “borrow” their best ideas into your games and give you tangible examples.
