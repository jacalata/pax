Do Brands Really Matter in Gaming
Cat Theatre
Sunday, 10:30am - 11:30am

We've all grown up with brands as an integral part of our lives and purchase behavior. It can be the sneakers we buy, food we eat, paint we use, books we read, movies or TV we watch, and of course the games we play. Does building a game based upon a branded IP ensure success? What are the opportunities and challenges of branding a game? Come listen to leaders within the industry from both camps who have launched branded games and from others who have launched without a brand.

Panelists include: Robert Ferrari [vice president of publishing and business development, Sanrio Digital], John Nam [chief operating officer, Neowiz Games America, Inc], Calvin Yang [vice president of marketing, ijji.com], Ben Colayco [CEO, Kill3r Kombo Interactive], Jason Wonacott [CEO, Wonacott Communications]

Game Mechanics and Mechanism Design
Wyvern Theatre
Sunday, 10:30am - 11:30am

"Mechanism Design" is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts required in good game design. Simply put, it is the idea that the game creator, by manipulating the rules of the game, can encourage, without coercion, particular play behavior. Or, to put it another way, a game can manipulate you into certain behaviors you might not otherwise have considered. While it's one of those scary, math-heavy "game theory" constructs, it can be illustrated (and used) without an advanced mathematics degree. If you're a gamer, it's likely been used to great effect on you already. Why not learn the secrets behind the science of game-centered mind control? From the creators of Beyond Dungeons & Dragons, Beyond Candyland, and Losing Should Be Fun.

Panelists include: Brandon "Rym" DeCoster [Producer, GeekNights], Scott Rubin [Host, GeekNights]

Public Play: The Secret to Making Games that Are Social, Embarrassing, and Fun!
Naga Theatre
Sunday, 11:00am - 12:00pm

Games are social. We play to compete, but we also play to let our guard down around strangers and strengthen our friendships. Why are so many people happy to make fools of themselves in Dance Central? Can Facebook games treat us as more than just marketing devices? And what's next for the non-player sidekicks we spend so much time with - isn't Dragon Age just a dating sim with blood spatter? This panel will bring experts from multiple fields together to talk about the ways that games bring us closer. Invitees will include a range of experts from academia (MIT Media Lab), the game industry (Harmonix), and designers of games that are meant to be played in public. And as an audience-participation bonus, we will include a game that can be played by the entire audience in just five minutes.

The Sorting Workshop
Cat Theatre
Sunday, 12:00pm - 1:00pm

Industry vets walk you through a writing exercise that will determine where in the industry an aspiring writer belongs. A game developer and publicist kick things off with a 10-minute product demo that you get 20 minutes to write up. Then we (journalists, community managers, publicists, and marketing specialists) sort your writing sample into which field it ought to be in based on tone, content, and accuracy. You won't be graded, but you might be mocked with dramatic readings of your sample. Whatever happens, you'll have a chance to make industry contacts and learn the difference between writing for journalism, for community management, for marketing, and for PR. Bring pens, pencils, and a surface to write on (we recommend the PAX guide) -- we'll provide the rest.

Panelists include: AJ Glasser [News Editor, GamePro Media], Susan Arendt [Senior Editor, The Escapist], Dan Amrich [Social Media Manager, Activision], Arne Meyer [Community Strategist, Naughty Dog], Sue Bohle [Boss, The Bohle Company]

One of Us
IGDA Dev Center
Sunday, 12:00pm - 12:50 pm

Are people surprised to learn that you're a gamer? Do the clerks at the Local Generic Game Retailer ignore you when you shop? If they do talk to you, do they assume you're shopping for something with more pink on the box? Or worse, ask you if you're buying a game for your son or boyfriend? Gamers who do not fit the stereotypical image of the hardcore gamer often feel left out in the cold. Our panel of game writers and hardcore gamers discuss the obstacles to acceptance they've faced and their strategies for coping with them.

Panelists include: Mark Barlet [President & CEO, The AbleGamers Foundation, Inc.], Regina Buenaobra [Community Manager, ArenaNet], David Edison [Writer, Gaygamer.net], Alex Horn [Writer, Big Huge Games/38 Studios], Alexandra Raymond [Writer, The Borderhouse Blog]

The Making of Octodad: A Game About Destruction, Deception, and Fatherhood
Merman Theatre
Sunday, 12:00pm - 1:00pm

Octodad. The game that forever changed the way we see tentacles and fatherhood. Beginning in June, a team of 19 students at DePaul University set to revolutionize gaming with unlikeliest of heroes -- an octopus that happens to be husband and wife to a human family.

These questions (and many more) will be answered by the core team behind Octodad in yet another supremely informative PAX panel.

Panelists include: Kevin Zuhn [Project Lead, DePaul University], Nick Esparza [Lead Artist, DePaul University], Jake Anderson [Lead Designer, DePaul University], John Murphy [Producer, DePaul University], Scott Roberts [Associate Professor, DePaul University]

When I Grow Up: It's Never Too Late to Try Something Crazy
Wyvern Theatre
Sunday, 12:00pm - 1:00pm

Two years ago, Sean Baptiste was at the top of his game. A wunderkind in social marketing in the game industry, he traveled the country meeting fans and celebrities- promoting games he loved. But an inoperable brain tumor and a series of surguries led to long ICU stays over several months. He came home and discovered that he had major memory problems-at times even forgetting his own name. Struggling with simple tasks most take for granted, Sean decided to do the scariest thing he could think of: stand-up comedy. A documentary crew followed Sean as he met a tutor, did an open mic, and debuted in a local stand-up night. Did he succeed? Watch the premiere screening of 'When I Grow Up' and talk to director (Trevor Chamberlain), stand-up tutor (Dana Bein) and editor (Jon Mercer) to find out!

Panelists include: Trevor Chamberlain [Director, Wicked Smart Kids], Dana Bein [Comedian], Jon Mercer [Editor], Urvi Fontenot [Producer], Sean Baptiste [Harmonix]

How to Win at Games
Naga Theatre
Sunday, 12:30pm - 1:30pm

It seems obvious that, when playing a game of skill, one attempts to win. Interestingly, this is often not the case, and even skilled gamers rarely analyze to any depth the underlying mechanics and strategy of a given game. By deconstructing the games we play, you too can make them far less fun for yourself, "seeing the Matrix" as it were, and beat the everliving hell out of your friends. We'll hit the theory pretty heavily, but also specific examples from games like "Advance Wars," "Settlers of Catan," and even "Risk." From the creators of "Beyond Candyland", "Beyond Dungeons & Dragons", "Losing Should be Fun", and "Game Mechanics and Mechanism Design" to name a few.

Panelists include: Brandon "Rym" DeCoster [Producer, GeekNights], Scott Rubin [Host, GeekNights]

Ten Games You Need to Play: The Digital Game Canon
IGDA Dev Center
Sunday, 2:00pm - 2:50 pm

This panel takes inspiration from the challenge of preserving game history and gets right to the key question: What is the canon of digital game history? What games should be first on the list for preservation? What games should game researchers and designers study? In other words, what games do you really need to play? Our panel mixes game designers, researchers, and journalists -- all players, too -- to answer this question. Expect to hear an appeal or two about the need to solve the problem of long-term preservation of these games as part of our cultural heritage...before they disappear forever.

It's not the Length, it's the Mirth: Game Length Versus Value
Wyvern Theatre
Sunday, 4:30pm - 5:30pm

With new forms of distribution for video games come new pricing models. Outlets like Apple's iOS App Store and digital distribution storefronts like Xbox Live Arcade and PSN are challenging the convention of $60 AAA retail titles, and complicating the already peculiar brand of calculus that gamers use when determining "value". Why is $1 okay on iPhone but $6 is too expensive? Why is one ten-hour retail game criticized for being "too short" while others aren't? Why are we so hung up on game length? Join Christopher Grant (editor-in-chief, Joystiq.com) and panelists as they wrestle with this age-old quandary.

Panelists include: Christopher Grant [Editor-In-Chief, Joystiq]
