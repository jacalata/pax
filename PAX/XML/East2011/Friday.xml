    name="The Making of an Announcement 'Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception"
    description="You may have watched the 'Uncharted 3: The Reveal' pieces on YouTube or the PSN Store recently - and if you haven't, for shame and go watch them now! The two-part video series barely scratches the surface on the immense effort and hectic pace of activities at a video game developer once an announcement date is set and the studio pulls together to put together a polished set of assets. Join Naughty Dog (developers of the UNCHARTED games) and 2 Player Productions (you may know them from PATV Season 1 and the Infamous and Uncharted web docs) as we delve deeper into the events leading up to the announcement of UNCHARTED 3: Drake's Deception. The Dogs will talk about the specific challenges in producing a highly polished gameplay demo, a completed trailer, along with screenshots and other announcement assets, within a short timeframe. During that time, 2 Player Productions were the first outsiders we've ever invited to document this process firsthand and they will join the Dogs to let you know what it was like to witness the chaos and excitement for themselves - and we've made them promise to bring some never-before-seen footage from the cutting room floor. We'll be sure to leave some time to answer questions at the end.
Panelists include: Arne Meyer [Community Strategist, Naughty Dog], Taylor Kurosaki [Cinematic Production Lead, Naughty Dog], Paul Levering [2 Player Productions], Paul Owens [2 Player Productions], Asif Siddiky [2 Player Productions]"

    name="House Rules and Stealing from Other Games in RPGS"
    description="Most Game Masters do it. Hacking your favourite RPG is as old as the hobby itself. However, one can often get bogged down with rules that defeat their intent and make the game less fun. Others have so many house rules that players and master alike get confused and lose sense of what game they're playing. That's why we invite you to join 3 well-known RPG bloggers from Critical-Hits and At-Will to discuss how to design, test, and organize house rules. They'll also tell you how to explore other classic and modern RPGs to 'borrow' their best ideas into your games and give you tangible examples.
