We kick off the night with a showing of Heavy Metal at 7pm, and Rock Band begins at 10pm (but you can do one or the other if you don't want to do both). The gentle jerks at Giant Bomb have agreed to sit in as judges, so hilarity is guaranteed. You can get more info and purchase tickets ($14 for the combo, $6 for RB) in advance here: http://brattlefilm.org/2011/03/10/rock-band-night/"

Drop off a mix, take a mix and maybe discover some new music in the process. Nothing too formal, just a good old fashioned music exchange. We'll be doing this all day long and maybe on into Saturday if there's enough interest."

However, we're not happy to just crawl the show floor with you – no, no. Instead, IGN is hosting a party on Saturday night and a live IGN Game Scoop! Podcast panel on Sunday.
The best part? We're giving away all sorts of free stuff – food, booze, Mortal Kombat Collector's Editions, etc. All you have to do is show up.
Interested?
Come grab some free appetizers and brews with your favorite IGN personalities – people like Jessica Chobot, Daemon Hatfield, Greg Miller, Anthony Gallegos, Ty Root and Walter Lopez. Space as well as the free Game Scoop! and Knockin' Boots T-shirts are limited, so get there early and have a ball. "

description="One of the many benefits of having a Pokewalker is meeting other people with Pokewalkers. At previous PAX it was awesome finding and meeting new people just by noticing the Pokewalker so I thought creating a meet up just for that would be a good idea.
What to Do:
Bring your Pokewalker to PAX with you copy of HG/SS of course. Make your Pokewalker viewable to all. Try putting it on your hat, lanyard, shirt, staff, etc. Just make sure it's well secured! Leave no Pokemon behind.
At the Meetup, say hi to your fellow PAX Trainer, link up Pokewalkers, Trade items, unlock routes and maybe even train and battle for the PAX Pokemon League. Also there will be Prizes!!!!!"
