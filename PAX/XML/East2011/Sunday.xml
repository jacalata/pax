description="We've all grown up with brands as an integral part of our lives and purchase behavior. It can be the sneakers we buy, food we eat, paint we use, books we read, movies or TV we watch, and of course the games we play. Does building a game based upon a branded IP ensure success? What are the opportunities and challenges of branding a game? Come listen to leaders within the industry from both camps who have launched branded games and from others who have launched without a brand.

name="Game Mechanics and Mechanism Design"

description="'Mechanism Design' is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts required in good game design. Simply put, it is the idea that the game creator, by manipulating the rules of the game, can encourage, without coercion, particular play behavior. Or, to put it another way, a game can manipulate you into certain behaviors you might not otherwise have considered. While it's one of those scary, math-heavy 'game theory' constructs, it can be illustrated (and used) without an advanced mathematics degree. If you're a gamer, it's likely been used to great effect on you already. Why not learn the secrets behind the science of game-centered mind control? From the creators of Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, Beyond Candyland, and Losing Should Be Fun.

This panel will bring experts from multiple fields together to talk about the ways that games bring us closer. Invitees will include a range of experts from academia (MIT Media Lab), the game industry (Harmonix), and designers of games that are meant to be played in public. And as an audience-participation bonus, we will include a game that can be played by the entire audience in just five minutes."

Then we (journalists, community managers, publicists, and marketing specialists) sort your writing sample into which field it ought to be in based on tone, content, and accuracy. You won't be graded, but you might be mocked with dramatic readings of your sample. Whatever happens, you'll have a chance to make industry contacts and learn the difference between writing for journalism, for community management, for marketing, and for PR.

A wunderkind in social marketing in the game industry, he traveled the country meeting fans and celebrities- promoting games he loved. But an inoperable brain tumor and a series of surguries led to long ICU stays over several months. He came home and discovered that he had major memory problems-at times even forgetting his own name. Struggling with simple tasks most take for granted, Sean decided to do the scariest thing he could think of: stand-up comedy. A documentary crew followed Sean as he met a tutor, did an open mic, and debuted in a local stand-up night. Did he succeed? Watch the premiere screening of 'When I Grow Up' and talk to director (Trevor Chamberlain), stand-up tutor (Dana Bein) and editor (Jon Mercer) to find out!

description="It seems obvious that, when playing a game of skill, one attempts to win. Interestingly, this is often not the case, and even skilled gamers rarely analyze to any depth the underlying mechanics and strategy of a given game. By deconstructing the games we play, you too can make them far less fun for yourself, 'seeing the Matrix' as it were, and beat the everliving hell out of your friends. We'll hit the theory pretty heavily, but also specific examples from games like 'Advance Wars,' 'Settlers of Catan,' and even 'Risk.' From the creators of 'Beyond Candyland', 'Beyond Dungeons and Dragons', 'Losing Should be Fun', and 'Game Mechanics and Mechanism Design' to name a few.

	description="With new forms of distribution for video games come new pricing models. Outlets like Apple's iOS App Store and digital distribution storefronts like Xbox Live Arcade and PSN are challenging the convention of $60 AAA retail titles, and complicating the already peculiar brand of calculus that gamers use when determining 'value'. Why is $1 okay on iPhone but $6 is too expensive? Why is one ten-hour retail game criticized for being 'too short' while others aren't? Why are we so hung up on game length? Join Christopher Grant (editor-in-chief, Joystiq.com) and panelists as they wrestle with this age-old quandary."
