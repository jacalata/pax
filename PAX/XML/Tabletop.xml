Join Vincent Baker (Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World) and Ben Lehman (Polaris, The Drifter's Escape) for a crash course in the tabletop roleplaying theories that kicked off the indie rpg movement. From social context and creative agenda to reward cycle, currency and the components of character, with a good hard look at the real causality at the table. Guaranteed to push conventional wisdom down and take its lunch money.
