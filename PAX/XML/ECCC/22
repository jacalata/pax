	<p class="rte">"Doctor Who" is the world's most successful science fiction television series. Debuting on the BBC in 1963, it ran for twenty-six years. In 2005, it was revived and became the worldwide phenomenon it is now, due in some small part to a new following in America. <br>Seattle is home to one of the few broadcasters of classic "Doctor Who" in the world. Find out more about this show, where it started, where it is now, and why it can run for at least another fifty years! Hosted by Eric Gjovaag, (The Emerald City Androgums) Ryan K. Johnson, (Founder, Society of the Rusting TARDIS) and Dan Murphy, (Emerald City Androgums).</p></div>
