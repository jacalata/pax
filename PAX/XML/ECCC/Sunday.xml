But the &quot;B&quot; in LGBT, bisexuality, has been portrayed a lot less frequently, and has more often been lumped into the &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;straight&quot; categories. With queer content more visible in the mainstream and LGBT bookstores and publishers on the wane, will our categorization of comics by what sexuality they portray become less important? How can creators thwart pressure from the straight and gay communities to put them in recognizable &quot;boxes&quot; and make them invisible? And how can creators effectively reach out to queer readers to read their work without losing straight ones?Join moderator Charles &quot;Zan&quot; Christensen (Northwest Press, Prism Comics) for a lively, thorny discussion about representations of sex and sexuality as we move into a world without categories. Panelists include Erika Moen (Dar!, Bucko), Ellen Forney (Marbles, I was Seven in '75), Randall Kirby (BOP!
