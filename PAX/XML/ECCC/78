	<p class="rte">Zombies, vampires, and werewolves are the most terrifying monsters to stalk the night. But what if these monsters existed in real life and actually stood trial for their murderous crimes? Would they be found guilty and put behind bars, or would they be found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a psychiatric hospital? Would they even be competent to stand trial? With the doctors of Broadcast Thought, <b>H. Eric Bender, M.D., Praveen R. Kambam, M.D.</b>, and <b>Vasilis K. Pozios, M.D.</b>, as your guide, explore the real-life medical conditions that may have contributed to the lore and legend of these creatures. Compare the behaviors of these characters to real-life blood-sucking and flesh-eating killers. Join the forensic psychiatrists as they evaluate how the "conditions" that plague these blood-suckers, flesh-eaters, and wild beasts may affect their criminal trials. Would their altered states also alter their criminal responsibility? See these iconic characters in a brand new light, and sink your teeth into them for a change!</p></div>
