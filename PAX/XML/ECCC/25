	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: HALL A (611-614)</strong><em><br/>Start: 6:30PM<br/>End: 7:25PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte">If all <b>Ray Park</b> ever did was portray Darth Maul in "Star Wars Episode 1", this panel would only be amazing. That fact that he's also gone on to portray such geek icons as Toad in the first "X-Men" movie, Chuck Norris in "The Legend of Bruce Lee" and Snake Eyes in both "G.I. Joe" movies only means this panel will be AMAZINGLY AWESOME! Moderated by Mike Jones (Producer, CBS Radio)<br></p></div>
