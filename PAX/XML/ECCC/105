	<p class="rte">America's Fighting Dinosaur is a faux-documentary series that explores the life and military career of Pvt. "Little" Sammy Vogel, a 7 ton, 40 foot long Army infantryman and T-Rex who fought for the Allies in WWII. Using photos, archive footage, letters and interviews with veterans and soldiers who served by his side, the series sheds some light on how America's biggest soldier managed to go unheard of for so long. We'll be premiering segments from the series and doing a Q&amp;A with writer/director<b> Steve Snoey</b>, producer <b>Lacey Leavitt</b>, cinematographer <b>Nathan Miller</b> and composer <b>Eric Nielson</b>.<br></p></div>
