	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: WORKSHOP - ROOM 401</strong><em><br/>Start: 4:00PM<br/>End: 4:55PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte"><b>Kyle Winters </b>and <b>Mike Andersen</b> used Kickstarter to successfully fund Trigger Men, their first venture in to the world of comics, but the road wasn't easy. At this panel they will discuss what they did right, what they did wrong, and what to do once you're funded. The goal is to give you, the aspiring indie creator, the real knowledge and know how needed to tackle self-publishing with the help of Kickstarter.</p></div>
