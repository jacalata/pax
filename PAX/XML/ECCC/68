After an 18+ late-show with comic artist <b>Lar deSouza</b>, you will be able to impress your friends with your new X-Rated folding skills! Let's be honest people, how often are you going to see something like this? A professional illustrator for over 20 years, Lar is the cartoonist for the 2008 Shuster Award winning online comics, "Least I Could Do", which is updated seven times weekly at www.leasticoulddo.com, and "Looking For Group", which is updated Mondays and Thursdays at www.lfgcomic.com .
