How about The Breakfast Club with a cast that included Hermes Conrad, Daphne Blake and Kilowog? Maybe The Lord of the Rings with Winnie the Pooh as Frodo and Timon as Samwise? Well, all things are possible at Movie Mash-Up! Join Phil LaMarr, Quinton Flynn, Grey DeLisle, Jim Cummings, Kevin Michael Richardson, Rikki Simmons, Jennifer Hale and Richard Horvitz as they on a variety of classic film roles!<br></p></div>
