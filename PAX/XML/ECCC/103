	<p class="rte">Straight Outta Comicon is fan comedy by professional geeks. Disheartened with the traditional stand-up comedy scene, travelling comics <b>Matt McInnis</b> and <b>Matt Keck</b> joined forces to set aside "club comedy" and "club material" to bring their true love, nerd comedy, to cons and like-minded fans across the country. Straight Outta Comicon is a two man stand-up comedy and variety show that has been welcomed by stages, fans and conventions far and wide. Straight Outta Comicon includes stand-up comedy, music, sketch work, improv, audience participation, and a staggering level of fandom. <br></p></div>
