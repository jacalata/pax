	<p class="rte">The landscape of the comics field has changed since the days of the letter column and the mimeographed fanzine. Now, readers and creators interact with each other through social media, and careers can be built (and sometimes ended?) entirely online. The online realm is not simply a means for promotion of print products or an avenue for digital distribution methods, but is an entirely new ecosystem of interaction, production, and communication. Join panelists <b>Allison Baker, Jen Vaughn, Shannon Watters, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Emi Lenox</b> for a discussion of what works in this new world, what doesn't, and what hasn't been tried yet.</p></div>
