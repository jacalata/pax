	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: HALL A (611-614)</strong><em><br/>Start: 7:30PM<br/>End: 8:25PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte">The current writing team of Marvel Now's Deadpool will discuss their work and try to answer your questions about comedy for comics, TV and movies. Then Gerry &amp; Brian will ask themselves why comedy is so un-fun to actually write. This will be followed by some incoherent mumbling and general regret. Attendees will learn nothing and leave dumber. Kill an hour before a popular panel!</p></div>
