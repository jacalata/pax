	<p class="rte">Everyone has some sense of right and wrong which generates a personal code of honor. This certainly applies to the heroes and villains we know and love, and also the writers and artists who tell their stories. As society embraces tolerance as an ultimate social virtue more and more, the line between good and evil continues to blur. How does society set clear boundaries? What happens when the heroism and villainy of the past are sanctioned by the future? Are graphic novels actually position papers on morality? Should writers and artists be held responsible for the messages they send about confronting bullies, resolving conflict, and stopping evil? "Building a Better World?" explores the ethics of various writers and artists and the impact it has on the stories they tell and ethics they promote. <br></p></div>
