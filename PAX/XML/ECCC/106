	<p class="rte">Karaoke Hero makes a return to the Emerald City Comicon courtesy of <b>Absolute Karaoke.</b> Join host Josh Baron as he brings you all the fun. Part singing contest, part costume contest, Karaoke Hero is all fun! Will you bear witness to a Silver Surfer singing "Space Oddity"? Or perhaps you will see The Punisher singing "Sound Of Madness". Anything is possible! No costume? No worries. Everyone is welcome to come sing. Heck, you don't even have to be a great singer! You just need the desire to have fun!</p></div>
