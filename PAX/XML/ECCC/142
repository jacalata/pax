	<p class="rte">Writer, artist, and teacher <b>Brian Stelfreeze</b> defines the term "triple threat" in the comic world. In his 30 year career in comics, Stelfreeze has never fallen into a classic comic role, moving from project to project as penciller, writer, painter, inker and colorist. As a founding member of Gaijin Studios, he helped establish the power of a group of freelance artists working together, and outside of comics he's an incredibly successful commercial illustrator and teacher. Join BOOM! Studios Vice President of Publishing and Marketing <b>Filip Sablik</b> for a retrospective look at his career to date and a look forward at what 2013 and beyond holds for this pivotal artist.</p></div>
