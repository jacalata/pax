	<p class="rte">With Marvel Comics latest adaptations of the L. Frank Baum novels, the journey to Oz is as popular as ever! First published in 1900, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" became a successful novel with comic adaptations appearing almost immediately thereafter, first as a newspaper strip and eventually in comic book form. With over a century of Oz comics in existence, Oz historian Eric Gjovaag delivers a panel that gives a history of Oz in the comics, right up to the latest adaptations and interpretations of today.</p></div>
