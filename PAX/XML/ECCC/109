	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: 2AB</strong><em><br/>Start: 1:00PM<br/>End: 1:55PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte">Join <b>Katie Cook</b> (My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic) and <b>Jim Zub</b> (Skullkickers) as they tell tales about what it can be like behind the convention table. Stories like that of a man in California that introduced a fox puppet as his son, to that of a man in a tiger costume that talked about his removable loincloth! Sometimes the folks that go to conventions really are "those weirdoes". Some stories will make you laugh out loud, some will make you cringe! (MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AGES!)</p></div>
