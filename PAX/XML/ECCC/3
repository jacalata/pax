	<p class="rte"><b>Billy Dee Williams</b> first gained public recognition portraying football player Gale Sayers in "Brian's Song" but it's his role as Lando Calrissian, Han Solo's roguishly suave friend in the original Star Wars trilogy, that gained him millions of fans worldwide. Come hear him talk about those roles as well as his work as an established painter, with some of his work being displayed in such prestigious institutions as The Smithsonian.
