	<p class="rte">Final Fantasy: The Improvised Adventures tells an improvised tale in the style of the Final Fantasy video games. Knights, wizards, thieves and scholars band together in a completely impromptu tale of swords and sorcery that will culminate in an epic struggle for the fate of the world. The series of over a dozen video games are lovingly riffed upon in this parody tribute. The experienced ensemble of actors, working with little more than their wits and imaginations will take ideas from the audience, and turn them into a sidesplitting production that will be enjoyed by both veterans of the series and complete strangers alike.</p></div>
