	<p class="rte">Comics and sequential art are becoming more widespread in all levels of education. Join us as we discuss the ways comics are showing up not only as a subject of college courses, but as forms of scholarship - Nick Sousanis is currently working on his PhD dissertation written entirely in comic form, for example. <br><b>Brooke Sheridan</b> (Instructional Designer, University of Alaska, Fairbanks) and <b>Chris Malberg</b> (Instructional Designer, U of A, Fairbanks) present a panel where they will talk about the new trend of comics in education as developed by the fans themselves, the people most familiar with the history and possibilities of comics. They will also speak about the line between pop culture and education blurring more and more.</p></div>
