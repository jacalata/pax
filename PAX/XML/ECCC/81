	<p class="rte">Rob Liefeld continues to be a creative dynamo in the industry and a polarizing creator for fans. Join us as we make the argument, through context and history, of the significant and lasting contributions Liefeld has made in the course of approximately 25 years in comics. The significance being, not since Jack Kirby has one creator been so prolific and maintained as high a profile, to generate characters, designs, and concepts, that have become canon for the industry and fans. Rob continues to make headlines with the 20th Anniversary of Image Comics last year, his renaissance and eventual leaving DC Comics New 52 relaunch and the rebirth of the Extreme titles! Whether youâ€™re a fan or a not, all will be welcome for what is sure to be one of the most talked about panels at Emerald City Comicon. Hosted by <b>Dr. Jeremy M. Matthews</b>.</p></div>
