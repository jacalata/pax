	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: MAIN HALL (6ABC)</strong><em><br/>Start: 4:00PM<br/>End: 5:00PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte">It's <b>Sir Patrick Stewart</b>! You'd listen to him read names from the phone book for an hour if that's what he wanted to do! Luckily, that's not what he'll be doing in this panel moderated by Marty Riemer (The Mountain, 103.7 FM). Instead, he will talk about his life and career and, if you're lucky, maybe a little bit about his upcoming return to the X-Men films as Professor Charles Xavier! It's recommended you come early as this panel will almost assuredly be filled to capacity!<br><br></p></div>
