	<p class="rte"><b>David Finch</b> has been a fan favorite right from the get go! From his early work on Cyberforce all the way through his current work on Batman: The Dark Knight, David has brought a passion to his artwork rivaled only by his desire to do more! Blair Butler talks to the man who helped destroy The Avengers (Disassembled) only to recreate them (The New Avengers), flooded New York City (Ultimatum) and helped create Batman's sexiest villain yet (White Rabbit)!<br></p></div>
