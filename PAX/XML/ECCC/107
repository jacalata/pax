	<p class="rte">You see the cute geek girl at the comic shop... but you have no idea what to say to her! Let us help you with "How To Talk To Girls", the panel that is equal parts comedy and social commentary that's been sprinkled with a bit of dating advice and served from a feminine point of view. (But don't let that scare you. It's really not that frightening!) Come for the laughs... but be forewarned. You just may learn something! Presented by <b>Molly McIsaac, Gail Simone, John Roderick, Sarah Kuhn </b>and<b> Forest Gibson</b>.</p></div>
