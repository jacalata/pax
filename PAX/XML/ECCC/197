	<p class="rte">The world-renowned artist <b>Coop</b> joins us for an hour to talk about his more than two decades long career creating subversive, vice-centric images. His smoking devils, big beautiful women, amped-up hotrods, and berserk monsters have become counter culture icons. A&nbsp; pioneer of the Lowbrow art movement, Coop has attained celebrity status in the gig poster, Kustom Kulture, and tattoo communities. Sure to be a fascinating hour!<br></p></div>
