This certainly applies to the heroes and villains we know and love, and also the writers and artists who tell their stories. As society embraces tolerance as an ultimate social virtue more and more, the line between good and evil continues to blur. How does society set clear boundaries? What happens when the heroism and villainy of the past are sanctioned by the future? Are graphic novels actually position papers on morality? Should writers and artists be held responsible for the messages they send about confronting bullies, resolving conflict, and stopping evil? &quot;Building a Better World?&quot; explores the ethics of various writers and artists and the impact it has on the stories they tell and ethics they promote.

In spite of this history, comics that treat adult sexuality as a central theme (as opposed to a headline grabbing gimmick) remain relatively rare, at least in the United States, and can still be subject to censorship when they do appear. Comics scholar Ben Saunders will offer a brief history of the explicit representation of sexual behavior in American comics, from the 1920's to the present, before engaging in conversation with legendary creator Howard Chaykin - a writer-artist who has genuinely extended the frontiers of the comics medium in his representations of graphic sexuality.
