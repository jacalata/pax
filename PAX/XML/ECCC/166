	<p class="rte">Copyright is a misunderstood, contentious, yet frequently referenced concept in discussion of creator rights and ownership. This panel will provide a historical and contemporary overview of what Copyright IS (an expression of an idea) and what it IS NOT (control over all expressions of idea). Tracing it's origins from when the Church controlled literacy and the power to print, up through the mighty hands of Disney, to the problematic nature of protecting "original ideas" when most ideas are derived from someone else's. (This panel is not intended to address issues of current creator ownership under work-for-hire agreements. That discussion would be better served as a discussion on the subject of contracts.)</p></div>
