	<p class="rte">"Liberator" is an independent short film starring Lou Ferrigno (The Incredible Hulk) as a washed-up, disgraced ex-superhero trying to get his life back on the rails. Rounding out the ubergeek all-star cast is Peta Wilson (La Femme Nikita), Michael Dorn (Star Trek TNG), Don 'The Dragon' Wilson' (Bloodfist) and Ed Asner (Up.) Liberator was financed both out of pocket and via a successful Kickstarter campaign, in which $26K was raised. But still, how could we possibly hope to compete with the 9-figure budgets of today's superhero movies with the budget of a Toyota? By being damn crafty and keeping true to what our fellow geeks really want in a movie! Check out the beginning of a new Sci Fi franchise!</p></div>
