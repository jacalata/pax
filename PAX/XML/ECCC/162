	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: WORKSHOP - ROOM 401</strong><em><br/>Start: 6:00PM<br/>End: 6:55PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte">Don't sign that contract until you attend this panel! <b>Katie Lane</b> and <b>Caitlin DiMotta</b>, attorneys dedicated to helping creators protect their rights and get paid fairly for the work they do, will show you how to read through (and understand!) your next contract with a publisher, client or collaborator. They'll help make sense of legalese, discuss some of the different ways copyrights can be divvied up in a contract, and talk about some of the pros and cons of work-for-hire jobs. A must attend panel for freelancers and independent artists! Due to time &amp; ethical constraints, the presenters will not be able to provide legal advice about attendees specific legal conundrums during this panel.</p></div>
