Fulfill your Obsessions, follow Trends, avoid Impairments, and compete with your fellow players to tell the greatest comic stories imaginable, even if you can't even draw a stick figure! For fans of manga, graphic novels, webcomics and anyone with a sense of humor. Pens, paper and cards provided. Hosted by <b>Jason Thompson</b> (Manga: The Complete Guide, King of RPGs). <br></p></div>
