	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: MAIN HALL (6ABC)</strong><em><br/>Start: 10:30AM<br/>End: 12:00PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte">Writer/actor Wil Wheaton and comedy/music duo Paul and Storm share a morning of stories, music, and a really, really long song about pirates. Both individually and in collaboration, Wheaton and Paul and Storm will endeavor not just to entertain, but to solve the majority of the world's problems over the span of 90 minutes. They believe this is an eminently realistic goal. All panel attendees guaranteed to come away with a minimum 23 point increase in IQ! (MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AGES!)<br></p></div>
