	<p class="rte">Adventure! Beautiful women! Exotic alien worlds! Seattle Experimental Theater is proud to present its original unscripted comedy "Where No Man Has Gone Before", a fully improvised parody of the original Star Trek TV series. Our cast will use suggestions from the audience to create a new alien planet for Captain Kirk and his crew to discover - the only certainty is that danger and hilarity await.&nbsp; "Where No Man Has Gone Before" has performed to sold-out houses in Seattle since June 2011 and is appropriate for all ages.
