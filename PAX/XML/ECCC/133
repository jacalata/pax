	<p class="size11"><strong>Room: 3AB</strong><em><br/>Start: 4:00PM<br/>End: 4:55PM</em></p><br/>
	<p class="rte">Part of Will Eisner Week, an annual celebration of Graphic Novels and Will Eisner, one of the giants of the field of sequential art. Scheduled just before what would have been Eisner's 96th birthday on March 6th, we are proud to present a panel of Eisner-experts discussing his ongoing influence 35 years after the publication of his groundbreaking graphic novel, "A Contract With God". Eisner's work is today more relevant and popular than ever. Panelists include <b>Dennis O' Neil</b> (Batman), <b>Batton Lash</b> (Supernatural Law), <b>Matt Fraction</b> (Hawkeye, Casanova) and <b>Jackie Estrada</b> (Will Eisner Awards). The panel will be moderated by Ben Saunders (Do the Gods Wear Capes). Will Eisner's other landmark works - including The Spirit and PS Magazine - will be discussed as well. <br></p></div>
