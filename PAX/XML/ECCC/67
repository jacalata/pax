	<p class="rte"><br>Most comic book fans have at least heard the name of Jack Kirby, co-creator of such archetypal superheroes as Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and The Fantastic Four. But comparatively few are aware of the full range and extent of Kirby's achievement. His most famous creations at Marvel represent just ten years out of a career that spanned four decades, and during which Kirby produced Western, War, Crime, Science-Fiction, and Romance comics - making him one of the most prolific and generically wide ranging artists in the history of the art form. Perhaps even fewer fans understand the full extent of Kirby's role in shaping the modern Marvel Universe, or the nature of his working relationship with Stan Lee, or why the issue of creative credit for those great comics is so controversial. Join <b>Professor Charles Hatfield</b> (Cal. State, Northridge) and <b>Professor Ben Saunders</b> (University of Oregon) as they offer an illustrated lecture in which they will survey Kirby's great career; detail the workings of the so-called "Marvel method" for creating comics; demonstrate the ongoing importance of Kirby's legacy; and argue for Kirby's reputation as one of the very greatest American comic-book creators of the 20th century. They will also take questions from the audience. By the end of this discussion, even skeptics will know why they should care about Jack Kirby!</p></div>
