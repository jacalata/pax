It follows Phil Fish, the creator of the highly- anticipated game, &quot;FEZ&quot;, as he shows it for the first time in 4 years at the PAX East. And, the film tells behind-the-scenes story an independent designer, Jonathan Blow, who made one of highest-rated video games of all-time, &quot;Braid&quot;.
Indie Game: The Movie is about making video games, but at its core, it&apos;s about the creative process and exposing yourself through your work.
