Each round, players will be seated at one of the many Munchkin standalone base sets (e.g. Munchkin, Munchkin Bites, Munchkin Fu, Munchkin Zombies, etc.). Every round, you will move to a different standalone Munchkin set, so by the end of the tournament, you will have played five different flavors of Munchkin. Each game, your Level will revert to 1, but you will be recording your cumulative Level total, round after round. So if you win every game you play, you might end up at Level 50, and be the tournament champion!"

description="We&apos;ll be asking players to show off their skill using every flavor of Dominion (Base, Intrigue, Seaside, Alchemy, Prosperity, Cornucopia) during the three set-aside time blocks:

Friday 03:00 pm - 09:00 pm (Session 1)
Saturday 03:00 pm - 09:00 pm (Session 2)
Sunday 10:30 am - 03:30 pm (Session 3)

You do not need to participate in all three sessions!!
Instead, you will be recording the results from your play sessions during these session time blocks. You might choose to play Alchemy and Prosperity on Friday, Cornucopia and the Base game Saturday, and Seaside and Intrigue on Sunday. Or you could power through, and record all six variants during a single session.
At your first session, and each time you play a game, you will fill out a scorecard. This scorecard will be used to record your placement and Victory Points for each of your six games. Your placement is the game (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) is the number of points you receive. Victory Points are recorded as a tiebreaker, but game finish trumps VPs.
Best score at the end of PAX is the winner. You can only log each variant once, so you will not be able to replace your record by playing the same expansion again later on.
So the best score possible at the end of PAX is 6 points, meaning you came in first place in all six games. The worst score is a 24. If you don't log a specific expansion play, you receive 4 points for it.
Each Kingdom card set will be pre-defined -- that way, there's no disparity when one game has the Witch, and one doesn't, when taking into account cumulative VPs for tiebreakers. Scorecards will be turned in to the session's Tournament Enforcer, who will record your results in our system, and then hand the card back to you. All games will be 4 player games whenever possible."
