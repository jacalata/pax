description="Gaming with your kids is a deeply excellent part of parenting. Instant bonding, plus it teaches them problem-solving, and even makes them shut up. But it&apos;s also a challenge: some spouses don&apos;t understand why games are important (if you&apos;re in a mixed gamer/non-gamer marriage). Some kids want to play violent games, or lame girly games that AREN&apos;T VIOLENT ENOUGH. Plus games are addictive, and kids aren&apos;t always emotionally ready to handle it when it&apos;s time to shut down and log off for the night. Hell, a lot of adults aren&apos;t. When do you start your kids on games? What games do you play with them, and what do you play them on? And how do you handle the hard parts?
