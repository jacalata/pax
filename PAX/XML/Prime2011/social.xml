Joining them with be chiptune artist Jonny Nero Action Hero and nerdy rapper and all-around nice guy Klopfenpop!
You can get into the event totally free, so long as you have a PAX Badge! Providing we have the room, of course.
You can guarantee your way in (and support the performers) by purchasing a ticket.
So come hang out with us, rock out with us, and show your support for these acts!"
