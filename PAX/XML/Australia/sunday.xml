For the first time in our collective lives we are protagonists in the public eye. Or are we? -- Panelists: Geek Culture is now chic thanks to shows like Beauty and the Geek and The Big Bang Theory, but are these shows portraying us as best they could, or are they putting us on display and making us dance so they can laugh at us? This panel&#8217;s aim will be to discuss the impact &#8220;geekface&#8221; or portrayal of geeks in mainstream media actually affects the geek community. Is the exposure of our lifestyle accurate in these shows? Does this exposure help or hinder geeks as a community?&#160; Is there such a thing as a fake geek?" end="Sunday 7/21/2013 12:30 PM" kind="Panel" location="Wombat Theatre" name="Is There Such a Thing As a Fake Geek?" /><Event datetime="Sunday 7/21/2013 12:00 pm" description="You&#8217;ve got 45 seconds to deliver your idea to our panel of experts.&#160; The top three pitches will be picked for prizes and swag!&#160; (Please note that this is an open forum - there&#8217;s nothing keeping anyone, judges and attendees alike, from stealing your ideas!&#160; If you&#8217;re not comfortable with this, please don&#8217;t pitch your idea!) -- Panelists: Jeff Kalles [Penny Arcade]" end="Sunday 7/21/2013 1:00 PM" kind="Panel" location="Dropbear Theatre" name="Pitch Your Game Idea" /><Event datetime="Sunday 7/21/2013 12:30 pm" description="For the first time, the Xbox One will be shown in Australia.

Perhaps one of their most bizarre applications has been in the massively multiplayer space, where a review of a title a week after launch will bear little resemblance to its quality some years down the track. With games increasingly being based on ongoing services, and being increasingly dependent on multiplayer numbers, servers, patches and support (the recent SimCity being a marvelous case in point), are static review scores losing their relevance? And is Polygon&#8217;s approach to the SimCity scenario (altering their static review score several times over) a viable solution? -- Panelists: Leigh Harris [Editor, MCV Pacific], Tim Stobo [Former designer at Team Bondi on LA Noire and at KMM Studios], Daniel Wilks [Editor, Hyper Magazine]" end="Sunday 7/21/2013 2:00 PM" kind="Panel" location="Wombat Theatre" name="Are Videogame Reviews Failing to Change With the Times?" /><Event datetime="Sunday 7/21/2013 1:30 pm" description="How much fun is it to get really good at your favourite games?

Games are a form of culture that build community like no other - often because you HAVE to share them to experience them. There are no institutions for games like libraries are for books&#8230; but what if libraries already ARE the institution we need? What does that mean - lending electronic games like e-books? Lending role-playing game books? Book-club-esque game clubs? Game design workshops? International gaming events hosted in the library? Some are on the way - and some are already here. With panellists from public, academic, and state library backgrounds, this is a session for anyone who loves games, libraries, or both!
