How much do you personally invest? How do you overcome these incredible odds? Or is there even a point? Come listen to people talk about both sides of the industry, those who made it and those who haven't.

description="Once upon a time, indie games were rare and solitary creatures, living lives of seclusion in the wilds of the internet - mod projects of best-sellers, small titles appealing to publishers to see a wider release. Now, thanks partly to the advent of programs like Steam, XNA, and Apple's App Store, indie gaming has been on the rise, moving from niche audiences to gain mainstream acclaim and attention. Join indie devs Brian Mitsoda and Annie VanderMeer Mitsoda (DoubleBear Productions, 'ZRPG'), James Silva (Ska Studios, 'Dishwasher: Dead Samurai'), Ron Alpert (Headcase Games, '180') and Derek Paxton and Matt Kimball (Theogenic, 'Fall From Heaven') about their experiences of going indie, tales of development, and advice for those looking to develop their own indie titles.

Are pros motivated by anything more than making a buck? Here’s your chance to find out – and to give them your side of the story. Bigfoot Networks, Alienware and AMD will join Evil Geniuses coach Alexander Garfield to make the case for pro gaming – why it means more PvP options, faster RnD and better gameplay overall.
