  description="Games are fun to most people that play them, but to many in the disabled community video games can be the only real window to the world they have. The evolution of the MMO has given people with disabilities a way to reach out and have contact with the world in ways that were not possible even 8 years ago. Worlds like SL, and games like EQ and WoW have given many disabled and socially isolated people a way to present themselves to the world in there own way. To not be defined by a wheelchair or other impairments that can become a barrier to rich social engagements, build life long friendships. We will talk about the importance of gaming to the disabled community, touch on the importance of supporting the needs of this community, and explain the benefits that outreach can bring a game.

Now, charmed by their talent and persistence, the beneficent rulers of PAX have opened their doors to these plucky lo-fi performers, and granted them a special chiptune music showcase to take place this year inside the PAX JamSpace!

If you answered yes to either of these questions this is the panel for you! This panel will primarily focus on how to improve your chops as a game writer, discuss the future of storytelling and narrative design in games and answer your questions about how to become a game writer. As rabid badger fighting is vastly simpler than game writing it will be covered more briefly as, while it is an essential skill for any game developer, you should be able to pick it up at home through our series of instructional YouTube videos or the excellent, recently published, Idiot’s Guide to Rabid Badger Combat (chapter 10 covers how to build bottled miniatures while fending off omnivorous weasels). All skill levels are welcome, from hobbyist game writers to industry veterans to gamers who just want to get more out of their games.
