Egregiously Unrealized Potential

How many times have you played a new game, only to think to yourself, 'Wow, this would have been awesome if they'd just done X?' How often do you imagine the never-made sequel to a game that was, for lack of a better term, itself a game-changer? These are not uncommon sentiments in the gaming community. But why is this the case? Conventional wisdom dictates that, if a market existed, these seemingly obvious games would be made. Are gamers naive and unrealistic? Or is there some yet unexplored factor in this phenomenon? From the creators of Beyond Dungeons & Dragons, Beyond Candyland, and Losing Should Be Fun.
