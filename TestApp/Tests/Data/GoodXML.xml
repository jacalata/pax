			Registration for ALL PC tournaments begins on Friday, September 3rd at 10am, right outside of the PC-Tournament area.
		Only full teams will be signed up. It is your job to join and/or create a team, we're not your babysitter. It is recommended you linger around the PC-Tournament area at signup time, and at tournament time and your chances of joining a team will be Pretty Good.
		Check-in time will begin 45 minutes prior to a tournament's starting time. Competitors are required to check-in at least 15 minutes before the tournament's start time. If you/your team doesn't check in during this time, your spot will be opened for another person/team.


General Information

		All tournaments will be exclusively using tournament computers provided by Intel and Nvidia. You will be allowed to bring over your mice and keyboards and customize your configurations, you will not be allowed to load software of any kind.
		If you sign up for a tournament, please be there. If you decide you will be unable to, check in with us and let us know so we can open up a spot for someone else.
		As a general rule, it's a good idea to show up at least 20 minutes in advance of each tournament, and that will give you time to configure your settings and warm up before the tournament begins."
